/**
 * operation-processing save data for processing operation, usages for the model:
 * 1) once process reach 100, then means process operation is done, progress is 0, means start
 * 2) processing operation will list in user's operation list, meanwhile, ready operation will
 * also list for user to process
 * 3) when operation is belong to workflow, once processing operation is done(processing operation progress 
 * is 100%), it will call back to operation, if all processing-operation is done and operation is done(
 * operation progress in 100%), operation will call back to work(workflow item), then work will determine
 * to start next operation(set next operation is ready), if operation is ready, then all users under that 
 * operation can access that operation and then can start that operation, once operation is start by someon
 * , then that operation is added into this operation-process table
